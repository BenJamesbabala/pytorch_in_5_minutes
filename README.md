# pytorch_in_5_minutes
This is the code for "PyTorch in 5 Minutes" by Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/nbJ-2G2GXL0) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. It's meant to be a demonstration of PyTorch's key features (dynamic computation graphs and imperative programming). This script builds a simple 2 layer neural net that learns the mapping between randomly generated input and output data. 

## Dependencies

* pytorch (Install it using the instructions [here](http://pytorch.org/))

## Usage

Run `python demo.py` in terminal to see the results

## Credits
